# React integration with Hooks

EVT provide two custom React Hooks located in `evt/hook`: `useEvt()` and `useStatefulEvt()` 

## "Hello World" Example 

 [Live code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/evt-hooks?embed=1&file=Hello.tsx)

Just a basic example to demonstrate how to use the Hooks.

## Comprehensive example: A TODO list app

This example is meant to show how EVT can help you build fully reactive UI that can be synced in real time across devices.
