# \_\_TMP

`waitFor(...)` and `attachOnce(...)` combined with matcher address the main shortcoming of EventEmitter allowing us to asynchronously wait for the next shape that is a circle, for example.

```typescript
import { Evt } from "ts-evt";

const evtShape = new Evt<Shape>();

evtShape.waitFor(matchCircle)
    .then(circle => console.log(`radius: ${circle.radius}`))
    ;

evtShape.$attachOnce(
    shape => shape.type === "SQUARE" && shape.sideLength > 100 ? 
        [ shape.sideLength ] : null,
    sideLength => console.log(`length: ${sideLength}`)
);


const circle: Circle = {
    "type": "CIRCLE",
    "radius": 33
};

//"radius: 33" will be printed to the console.
evtShape.post(circle);

//Nothing will be printed on the console, the promise returned by waitFor has already resolved.
evtShape.post(circle);

//Nothing will be printed, the side length is too short
evtShape.post({
    "type": "SQUARE",
    "sideLength": 12
});

evtShape.post({
    "type": "SQUARE",
    "sideLength": 21
});
//"length: 21" have been  printed to the console.

//Noting will be printed, attachOnce's callback function has already been invoked.
evtShape.post({
    "type": "SQUARE",
    "sideLength": 44
});
```
